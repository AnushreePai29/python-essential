# What is Machine Learning, and why is it essential in today's world? Discuss at least three real-world applications of Machine Learning and AI.  

##Machine Learning:
### Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from data and improve their performance on a specific task  without being explicitly programmed. Instead of being hand-coded with rules, ML algorithms can identify patterns and make predictions based on the data they are trained on.
